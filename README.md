# Extensions to Tomas's word2vec
This project makes some extension to the [word2vec tool](http://code.google.com/p/word2vec/).

Current extensions including:

### Binary Tree for HS using word embedding info

Rebuild the binary tree every several iterations, using the temporary word embedding vectors.
Get better performance than the original HS, with a little overhead of speed. But still worse than NEG mothod. 


For more details see the [project page](http://wantee.github.io/word2vec-fork/).
